# This analysis is Part 2 of the API & charting challenge.

# The exercise calls for using Geoviews library. I have also included a second method using Folium.
# The purpose was to see the two methods side by side.

# This is called VacationPy. The script imports the 'cities.csv' file from Part 1 of the challenge exercise.
# There is ETL that happens to account for nulls, and the return result is a map plot showing all valid cities.

# Criteria is added to keep the bounds of humidity between 60% and 80%.
# The temperature is a minimum of 23.0ยบ C.

# Some source code was contained in the exercise files provided.
# I completed this exercise mostly alone; two tutors helped with the final part. AI was helpful in troubleshooting erroneous code.
